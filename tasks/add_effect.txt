Aura is a website for burning creative, interesting captions into video. When adding a new effect our process is like this:

1. Create a demo of the effect. This is a standalone html page in the public/experiments folder. Any required data or constants are hard coded so that the demo is not reliant on any server resources. You can see an example demo at public/experiments/neon.html. The orginal demo will remain in the experiments folder for future reference.

2. The next step is to add the code for the effect into the effects library so it can be used by other pages. Look at the effects in public/effects.mjs. Now extract out the effect in the demo so it's a function like those. Note that while the demo may have staticly coded words, the effects must accept a transcript, font size, and so on.

3. Update holo.html to show the new effect as an option, and integrate with effects.mjs

4. Update local_captions.mjs to support the new effect
